In this lab, you will perform symmetric encryption and hashing utilising one of the most widely
used crypto tools called Openssl. It is widely used in Internet web servers, serving a majority
of all web sites. OpenSSL contains an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS
protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic
cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of
the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.
In this lab, we will use its different utility functions to perform symmetric encryption and
hashing. You will be given a set of tasks for using Openssl to perform these functions. For this
you will also need to use an HEX editor like GHex in Ubuntu. Follow the instructions, complete
the tasks and prepare a report as per instructed.
